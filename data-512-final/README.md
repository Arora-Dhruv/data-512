# Final project preliminary proposal
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented public health and economic crises. The idea is to apply data science skills to explore COVID-19 data for US and come up with research questions that can potentially help  different govt. agencies to make data driven decisions. My plan is to focus on understanding the relationship between testing, confirmed positive cases and hospitalization. More details are in the notebook.
